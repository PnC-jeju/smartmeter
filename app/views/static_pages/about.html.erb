<h2>What Is Smart Water?</h2>
<p>
Smart water refers to a network of smart water meters and intelligent infrastructure deployed as part of an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) system. It provides continuous and historical data, while improving system intelligence, visibility, automation and control to help water utilities optimize their water network. Smart water metering systems are available for utilities of all types, regardless of population, location, city size or existing infrastructure.

<h2>How Do Smart Water Metering Systems Work?</h2>
<p>Smart water metering systems are comprised of meters, endpoints, a data collection system and system management. Water meters measure water flow 24/7. The accompanying endpoints collect the flow data and securely transmit it to the data collection system at routine intervals. Within the smart water data collection system, utilities can monitor their network to identify leaks, address issues and bill customers more accurately.</p>
